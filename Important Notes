 COMMON MISTAKES

1. There should only one WHERE clause in a query, the subquery might contain more, but only one WHERE in a query. 

2. JOIN statements are very versatile and be written as follows
https://leetcode.com/problems/average-selling-price/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=top-sql-50
SELECT p.product_id, IFNULL(ROUND(SUM(p.price*u.units)/SUM(u.units),2), 0) average_price 
FROM prices p
LEFT JOIN UnitsSold u 
on p.product_id = u.product_id AND  
u.purchase_date BETWEEN p.start_date AND end_date
GROUP BY p.product_id;

3. DATE-TIME should be enclosed in ''
2019-06-28 IS Wrong        '2019-06-28' IS Correct

4. Given a table student -> name, id <- ALL STUDENTS AE IN THIS TABLE
marks in olympiad -> student_id, subject, marks <- ONLY THOSE WHO APPEARED IN OLYMPIAD ARE IN THIS TABLE
IF I have to tell which student didn't appear in olympiad exam
SELECT name FROM student WHERE id NOT IN (SELECT student_id FROM marks);

5. Given a table 
Sports_total -> sports_id, sports_nmae
Sports_played -> student_id, sports_id
We want to calculate what is % of total sports played by a particular student

SELECT sp.student_id, ROUND((COUNT(sports_id)/(SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT(sports_id)) FROM sports_total) * 100), 2)
FROM sports_played sp
ORDER BY student_id;

6. ORDER BY should occur before GROUP BY

7. INNER JOIN me jab ek hi row pe check lagana tab AND
Otherwise use WHERE
Select student_name, class
FROM school
INNER JOIN school ON student_name = student_name
AND marks_in_final > marks_in_half_yearly;

VS
Select student_name, class
FROM school
INNER JOIN school ON student_name = student_name
WHERE (marks_in_final, attendance_in_last_quarter) > (SELECT marks_in_half_yearly, attendance_in_first_quarter FROM school);

8. Table -> employee
id | name | department | managerId
We are required to find the number of managers with at least 5 reporters
Always remember in such cases to find the PRIMARY KEY, as the name can be REPEATED.


9. There's this deadly keyword
LIMIT 
SELECT * FROM users
LIMIT 1 OFFSET 10;
This will skip the first 10 rows and display only 1 next row

10. Union keyword is used to combine the query results from same or different table
It must be ensured that the number of columns being printed and the data types of these columns should be same for the queries.
SELECT name FROM students
UNION
SELECT name FROM teachers,

UNION allows only unique values 
whereas, UNIONALL allow all duplicate values too.



11. SELECT * FROM (
    SELECT * FROM users1 ORDER BY id ASC LIMIT 1
    )
    UNION ALL
    SELECT * FROM (
    SELECT * FROM users1 ORDER BY id DESC LIMIT 1)

This will give us the first and last rows
