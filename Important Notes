 COMMON MISTAKES

1. There should only one WHERE clause in a query, the subquery might contain more, but only one WHERE in a query. 

2. JOIN statements are very versatile and be written as follows
https://leetcode.com/problems/average-selling-price/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=top-sql-50
SELECT p.product_id, IFNULL(ROUND(SUM(p.price*u.units)/SUM(u.units),2), 0) average_price 
FROM prices p
LEFT JOIN UnitsSold u 
on p.product_id = u.product_id AND  
u.purchase_date BETWEEN p.start_date AND end_date
GROUP BY p.product_id;

3. DATE-TIME should be enclosed in ''
2019-06-28 IS Wrong        '2019-06-28' IS Correct

4. Given a table student -> name, id <- ALL STUDENTS AE IN THIS TABLE
marks in olympiad -> student_id, subject, marks <- ONLY THOSE WHO APPEARED IN OLYMPIAD ARE IN THIS TABLE
IF I have to tell which student didn't appear in olympiad exam
SELECT name FROM student WHERE id NOT IN (SELECT student_id FROM marks);
